      Coheed and Cambria[a] is an American progressive rock band from Nyack, New
      York, formed in 1995. The band consists of Claudio Sanchez (vocals,
      guitars, keyboards), Travis Stever (guitars, vocals), Josh Eppard (drums,
      keyboards, backing vocals), and Zach Cooper (bass, backing vocals).[1] The
      group's music incorporates aspects of progressive rock, pop, heavy metal,
      and post-hardcore.[2] Most of Coheed and Cambria's albums are concept
      albums based on a science fiction storyline called The Amory Wars, a
      series written by Claudio Sanchez, which has been transcribed into a
      series of comic books as well as a full-length novel.[3] The band has
      released nine studio albums, three live albums, and several
      special-edition releases. Their most recent release, Vaxis â€“ Act I: The
      Unheavenly Creatures, is a return to The Amory Wars concept following
      2015's The Color Before the Sun, the band's first non-conceptual album
      since their inception. The Color Before the Sun, The Afterman: Descension,
      Year of the Black Rainbow and Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume
      One: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness all reached the Billboard top
      10
